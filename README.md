# kedboard

A web based musical keyboard toy that uses keys which are mathematically aligned to perfect ratios of frequencies rather than the standard western 12-tone equal temperament.

I created this because pianos, notes, keys, and music theory are nonsensical gibberish based on arbitrary decisions made hundreds of years ago and only stuck around because of cultural momentum.

There is of course some reprocussions from doing it like this. The normal keyboard is divided into 12 equally spaced notes (KIND OF...), but the divisions in this one are not equal, despite looking like it. This also means it's always tuned to the key of your root note, you can't play in other keys (i think, I still barely understand music theory).
